# tsz

_Advanced optimizing compiler for TypeScript._

> Attention: This library is currently a _work-in-progress_ and _proof-of-concept_. It is not done yet and only works with a subset of TypeScript code and performs optimizations. The plan is to rewrite this once it is shown that every major optimization can be successfully performed on this subset of JS.
